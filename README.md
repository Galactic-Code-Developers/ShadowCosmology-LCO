# Shadow-Structured Cosmology  
### Lexicographic Coherence and the Geometry of Observation  
**Data, Code, and Reproducibility Repository**

This repository provides the computational components associated with:

**Valamontes (2025)**  
*Shadow-Structured Cosmology: Lexicographic Coherence and the Geometry of Observation.*

It includes minimal working implementations of:

- LCO-constrained reconstruction  
- Shadow Transfer Function analysis  
- Dual-geometry diagnostics  
- Entropy-coupling diagrams  
- Synthetic cosmological test data  

The goal is full scientific transparency and referee-level reproducibility.
